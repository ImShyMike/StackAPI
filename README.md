# Stack API

> Ever needed to use a stack to store values but your programming language doesn't have it?
> Me neither!

This very useful API provides a way to create and use a stack on the cloud! It provides many operations such as push, pop, size and peek to use for your stack.

## FAQ

### Isn't this API useless?

~~Yes.~~ No, with this API you can store and retrive values very ~~slow~~ fast so your app can run at blazingly fast speeds!

### Why use plaintext instead of JSON?

~~JSON sucks.~~ The choice to not use JSON was made to ~~not require a JSON parser~~ improve user experience and ease of use of the API.

### Does this even have any security?

~~Kind of.~~ The only way to access/modify each stack is by using the securely generated ID given to you after creating it.
